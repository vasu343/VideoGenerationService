Following are the assumptions made :- 
1) The Generate Video service is getting details like pdfid and mapping info
2) The image by page number is given by a call to another service which already exists
3) The video is generated by the concatenation of all the images obtained from this service 
4) The exact video generation part is a black box 


Info about the service :- 
- created a generate video service which takes in pdfId and mapping info :- some implementation is purposely left out
- There exists a seperation of concerns in the microservice with the Following layers :- service layer, transport layer, Data access layer and an authentication layer
- These layers function as a decorator to the handler serving the request
- More layers such as middleware layer for logging can be added similarly
